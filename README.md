#  The Sound of FOMO: How Sad Songs Amplify Digital Loneliness in Gen Z

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is part of the Capstone Project from the Data Analysis training program. I analyzed a *sad songs playlist* that I listened to over the last three months and combined it with a *mini survey* exploring the habit of listening to sad songs among Gen Z.

The main objective is to uncover how sad songs correlate with feelings of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and digital loneliness in today's connected generation.


##  Dataset  
### 1. Sad Songs Playlist  
- *File:* Daftar_Lagu_Sad_Songs.csv  
- Contains a list of tracks, the dates they were listened to, and whether they are considered “sad” or not.

### 2. Survey Data  
- *File:* Survey_Responden_Lagu_Galau.xlsx  
- Google Form responses about emotional impact, listening context, and music preferences related to sad songs.


##  Analysis & Visualization  
Data was analyzed using Python (Google Colab) and Google Spreadsheet. The visualizations include:
- 🟠 *Pie Chart:* Proportion of sad vs non-sad songs
- 🔵 *Line Chart:* Monthly trend of listening to sad songs
- 🟣 *Bar Chart:* Most frequently appearing artists
- 🟢 *Survey Charts:* From Google Form/Spreadsheet representing listener habits & sentiments


##  Tools Used  
- *Google Colab* (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- *Google Spreadsheet*  
- *ChatGPT / Gemini AI* (for ideation and code assistance)  
- *IBM SkillsBuild* (course modules and framework)

##  Results & Insights  
- Sad songs dominated in specific time windows  
- Peaks in listening occurred toward the end of each month or during late-night hours  
- *Top recurring artist:* Lana Del Rey  
- Listeners often chose sad songs to feel emotionally understood—not necessarily to deepen sadness
